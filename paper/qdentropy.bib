Because the electronic structure is key to understanding their chemical properties, methods that probe these energy levels in situ are important. We show how electrostatic force detection using atomic force microscopy reveals the electronic structure of individual and coupled self-assembled quantum dots. An electron addition spectrum results from a change in cantilever resonance frequency and dissipation when an electron tunnels on/off a dot. The spectra show clear level degeneracies in isolated quantum dots, supported by the quantitative measurement of predicted temperature-dependent shifts of Coulomb blockade peaks. Scanning the surface shows that several quantum dots may reside on what topographically appears to be just one. Relative coupling strengths can be estimated from these images of grouped coupled dots.},

Traditionally, such highly correlated electron systems have been studied mainly in materials with complex transition metal chemistry. Over the past decade, researchers have learned to confine one or a few electrons within a nanometre-scale semiconductor 'artificial atom', and to understand and control this simple system in detail(3). Here we combine artificial atoms to create a highly correlated electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure. We tune the system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states, each a version of the Kondo state, in which a bound electron interacts with surrounding mobile electrons. The boundary between these competing Kondo states is a quantum critical point-namely, the exotic and previously elusive two-channel Kondo state, in which electrons in two reservoirs are entangled through their interaction with a single localized spin.},

@article{Gustavsson2009,
abstract = {We use time-resolved charge detection techniques to investigate single-electron tunneling in semiconductor quantum dots. The ability to detect individual charges in real-time makes it possible to count electrons one-by-one as they pass through the structure. The setup can thus be used as a high-precision current meter for measuring ultra-low currents, with resolution several orders of magnitude better than that of conventional current meters. In addition to measuring the average current, the counting procedure also makes it possible to investigate correlations between charge carriers. Electron correlations are conventionally probed in noise measurements, which are technically challenging due to the difficulty to exclude the influence of external noise sources in the experimental setup. Using real-time charge detection techniques, we circumvent the problem by studying the electron correlation directly from the counting statistics of the tunneling electrons. In quantum dots, we find that the strong Coulomb interaction makes electrons try to avoid each other. This leads to electron anti-bunching, giving stronger correlations and reduced noise compared to a current carried by statistically independent electrons. The charge detector is implemented by monitoring changes in conductance in a nearby capacitively coupled quantum point contact. We find that the quantum point contact not only serves as a detector but also causes a back-action onto the measured device. Electron scattering in the quantum point contact leads to emission of microwave radiation. The radiation is found to induce an electronic transition between two quantum dots, similar to the absorption of light in real atoms and molecules. Using a charge detector to probe the electron transitions, we can relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorption of a single photon. Moreover, since the energy levels of the double quantum dot can be tuned by external gate voltages, we use the device as a frequency-selective single-photon detector operating at microwave energies. The ability to put an on-chip microwave detector close to a quantum conductor opens up the possibility to investigate radiation emitted from mesoscopic structures and gives a deeper understanding of the role of electron-photon interactions in quantum conductors. A central concept of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality; matter exhibits both wave- and particle-like properties and cannot be described by either formalism alone. To investigate the wave properties of the electrons, we perform experiments on a structure containing a double quantum dot embedded in the Aharonov-Bohm ring interferometer. Aharonov-Bohm rings are traditionally used to study interference of electron waves traversing different arms of the ring, in a similar way to the double-slit setup used for investigating interference of light waves. In our case, we use the time-resolved charge detection techniques to detect electrons one-by-one as they pass through the interferometer. We find that the individual particles indeed self-interfere and give rise to a strong interference pattern as a function of external magnetic field. The high level of control in the system together with the ability to detect single electrons enables us to make direct observations of non-intuitive fundamental quantum phenomena like single-particle interference or time-energy uncertainty relations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The non-Abelian statistics are linked to the presence of additional low energy states in a system with localised quasiparticles, and hence an additional low-temperature entropy. Recent experiments, which detect changes in the number of quasiparticles trapped in a local potential well as a function of an applied gate voltage, V{\_}G, provide a possibility for measuring this entropy, if carried out over a suitable range of temperatures, T. We present a microscopic model for quasiparticles in a potential well and study the effects of non-Abelian statistics on the charge stability diagram in the V{\_}G-T plane, including broadening at finite temperature. We predict a measurable slope for the first quasiparticle charging line, and an even-odd effect in the diagram, which is a signature of non-Abelian statistics.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate the working principle of a new kind of energy harvester, proposed recently, using two capacitively coupled quantum dots. We show that, due to the novel three-terminal design of our device, which spatially separates the heat reservoir from the conductor circuit, the directions of charge and heat flow become decoupled. This enables us to manipulate the direction of the generated charge current by means of external gate voltages while leaving the direction of heat flow unaffected. Our results pave the way for a new generation of multi-terminal nanoscale heat engines.},

abstract = {Pure spin currents are generated and detected in micron-wide channels of a GaAs two-dimensional electron gas, using quantum point contacts in an in-plane magnetic field as injectors and detectors. The enhanced sensitivity to spin transport offered by a nonlocal measurement geometry enables accurate spin current measurements in this widely studied physical system. The polarization of the contacts is used to extract the quantum point contact g factor and provides a test for spontaneous polarization at 0.7 structure. The spin relaxation length in the channel is 30-50 microm over the magnetic field range 3-10 T, much longer than has been reported in GaAs two-dimensional electron gases but shorter than that expected from Dyakonov-Perel relaxation.},

abstract = {Two electronic channels competing to screen a single impurity spin, as in the two-channel Kondo model, are expected to generate a ground state with nontrivial entanglement structure. We exploit a spin-chain representation of the two channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy, negativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization group approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels we confirm field theoretic predictions for the boundary entropy difference, {\$}\backslashln (g{\_}{\{}UV{\}}/g{\_}{\{}IR{\}})=\backslashln(2)/2{\$}, between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the leading {\$}\backslashln(x)/x{\$} impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity entanglement, {\$}S{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}imp{\}}{\}}{\$}, is shown to scale with the characteristic length {\$}\backslashxi{\_}{\{}2CK{\}}{\$}. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of the impurity with one of the channels {\$}-{\$} as measured by the negativity{\$}-{\$} faithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition appearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit determination of critical exponents, {\$}\backslashnu\backslash!\backslashapprox\backslash! 2{\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta \backslash!\backslashapprox\backslash! 0.2{\$}. Finally, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement, measured by the tangle, only in the vicinity of the critical point.},

The theory extends the classical theory of Coulomb-blockade oscillations by Kulik and Shekhter to the resonant-tunneling regime. Both the cases of negligible and strong inelastic scattering in the quantum dot are considered. Effects from the non-Fermi-Dirac distribution of electrons among the energy levels (occurring when kT is comparable to the level separation) are fully included. Explicit analytic results are obtained for the periodicity, amplitude, line shape, and activation energy of the conductance oscillations.},
